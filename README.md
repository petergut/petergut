I'm a Musician/IT Professional, or a IT Professional/Musician... it's still not
clear to me which. In any event, I've been programming for quite a while. And making
music for quite a while as well.

I conducted the Valley Light Opera (Amherst, MA) for a couple seasons in the early
1990's, and Commonwealth Opera (Northampton, MA). After the upheavals precipitated
by the 2001 World Trade Center attacks, I moved with my wife, Beth, to Knoxville, TN
and worked for a local internet service provider (back in the days when internet
service providers *could* be small. Before leaving Western Massachusetts, I had been
working as production manager of an well-established pre-press trade shop, and 
spearheaded the efforts to "go digital," and had branched into programming using 
LAMP technologies. Moving to Knoxville, I made the jump to programming full-time, again
using LAMP.

My wife was offered a position in Pittsburgh about a year later and we move there. I got 
a position as web manager for the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust and managed that organization's
initial foray into online performance ticket sales, integrating with their Tessitura client
management system.
