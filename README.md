I'm a Musician/IT Professional, or a IT Professional/Musician... it's still not
clear to me which. In any event, I've been programming for quite a while. And making
music for quite a while as well.

I conducted the Valley Light Opera (Amherst, MA) for a couple seasons in the early
1990's, and Commonwealth Opera (Northampton, MA). After the upheavals precipitated
by the 2001 World Trade Center attacks, I moved with my wife, Beth, to Knoxville, TN
and worked for a local internet service provider (back in the days when internet
service providers *could* be small. Before leaving Western Massachusetts, I had been
working as production manager of an well-established pre-press trade shop, and 
spearheaded the efforts to "go digital," and had branched into programming using 
LAMP technologies. Moving to Knoxville, I made the jump to programming full-time, again
using LAMP.

My wife was offered a position in Pittsburgh about a year later and we move there. I got 
a position as web manager for the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust and managed that organization's
initial foray into online performance ticket sales, integrating with their Tessitura client
management system. A few years later I pitched my experience with Tessitura and joined 
Digitalwork in Chicago. My wife remained in Pittsburgh for a couple more years. In our first year, we commuted back
and forth to visit. In the second year, I worked remotely from Pittsburgh. We returned to
Chicago together the following year, owing to the financial turbulence of the 2008 banking
crisis. 

I remained with Digitalwork for a few more years, working primarily at this time using
Microsoft .Net. Our customers were larger performing arts organization, all using the 
Tessitura software. I devised a common platform upon which the customer sites could be
customized to facilitate development and be able to offer customers an ever-expanding feature-set. 
I developed a select-your-own-seats module, built entirely in HTML (competitors in this
space we're doing this exclusively using Macromedia Flash) and deployed this to several of our 
customers. The lingering effects of the
2008 recession ultimately took its toll on Digitalwork. In 2011, I joined the University of Chicago,
Biological Sciences division as a .Net programmer in the Academic and Administrative 
programming group.

I've advocated for using the most up-to-date programming technologies and 
approaches, while trying to avoid building "fully-buzzword-compliant" applications. In 2020,
our portfolio of project expanded when we inherited further development and maintenance of
a web-based Clinical Trial Management system. It's an **Angular** application talking to a 
.NetCore backend. This was a quick gear-change for us, and the customers seem to be very 
pleased with the results.

For several years now I've returned to music-making in a form that I had last used in 
undergraduate school: as a trombone player. While in Chicago, I participated in concert
bands, as well as jazz ensembles. In 2020 we relocated to Columbus, OH to be nearer our
daughter, who has lived there since 1999 and now has her own family. I continue to work
remotely for the University of Chicago, and have joined the Dublin Community Wind Ensemble.
